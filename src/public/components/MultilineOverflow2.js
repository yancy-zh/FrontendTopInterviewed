      It’s been a busy week for Chicago in the world of entertainment. FX’s
      streaming blockbuster The Bear, set in a Chicago sandwich shop turned
      fine-dining establishment, received 23 Emmy nominations, a record for a
      comedy series. David E. Kelley’s adaptation of Scott Turow’s legal
      thriller Presumed Innocent, which casts Jake Gyllenhaal as an adulterous
      Chicago prosecutor, was renewed for a second season on Apple TV+. But the
      biggest news was the death of legendary comedian Bob Newhart. The
      Chicago-area native was one of the most successful stand-up artists of the
      1960s, and he used the deadpan shtick perfected in his comedy routines to
      great effect in a pair of hit sitcoms in the ’70s and ’80s. The “City of
      Big Shoulders” continues to serve as an incubator for screen talent, as
      well as the backdrop for some of the most compelling stories on TV and in
      film.
